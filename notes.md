# My Experiential Notes

### Git and Github
- I learned a lot about how to deal with conflicts while pulling and pushing commits.

### AWS
- My site's elastic ip: `http://54.161.128.237/`
- connect to the back end of the instance using: `ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]`
- one day i will need to upgrade to at least a t3.nano
- key pair files allow controlled access to the site

### Route 53
- My domain is `parksonline.click`
- `simon.parksonline.click` and other prefixes also route to my website

### Caddy and Encryption
- to exit VIM, press ESC and type ':wq'
- Caddy kinda just takes care of everything
