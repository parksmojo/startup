                Have you ever played Rock Paper Scissors? Have you ever wished it was even cooler? 
                Now you can play the classic game with an added twist, a gun! The gun is beaten 
                by the rock, but beats both paper and scissors. Play against a cpu or even your 
                friends, and see how you stack up against others!
