# My Experiential Notes

### Git and Github
- I learned a lot about how to deal with conflicts while pulling and pushing commits.

### AWS
- My site's ip: `http://54.161.128.237/`
- connect to the back end of the instance using: `ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]`
- one day i will need to upgrade to at least a t3.nano
- key pair files allow controlled access to the site
